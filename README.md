# BITPAY - Bitcoin Payment System with Internet Computer

## Overview
BITPAY is a **Bitcoin payment system** designed to provide **fast, low-cost transactions** using **ckBTC** on the **Internet Computer (ICP)**. It leverages ICP's **Bitcoin Integration API** and UTXO tracking to facilitate **trustless, non-custodial payments**. The system is optimized for **merchants** and businesses that need a **secure and efficient way** to accept Bitcoin transactions.

## Features
- **ckBTC Transactions**: Utilizes **wrapped Bitcoin (ckBTC)** for **low-cost, fast transactions**.
- **Bitcoin Integration API**: Direct interaction with the **Bitcoin blockchain** for transaction tracking.
- **Trustless & Non-Custodial**: Ensures security by **eliminating third-party control** over funds.
- **UTXO-Based Payments**: Tracks unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs) to **confirm transactions**.
- **Merchant Support**: Allows businesses to create **payment requests** and track transactions.
- **Threshold ECDSA Signing**: Uses **threshold cryptography** for secure Bitcoin transactions.
- **Automated Transaction Confirmation**: Monitors payments in multiple stages (**pending, detected, confirmed**).
- **Multi-Account Management**: Enables merchants to manage **subaccounts and receive payments separately**.

## Architecture
BITPAY is built using **ICP smart contracts (canisters)** and follows a modular architecture:

1. **Bitcoin API Canister**: Interfaces with ICP's **Bitcoin Integration API** to query the blockchain.
2. **ckBTC Ledger Canister**: Maintains records of wrapped Bitcoin balances and transactions.
3. **Transaction Processor Canister**: Handles payment requests, UTXO tracking, and confirmation.
4. **Merchant Management Module**: Supports **multiple merchant accounts** and tracks payments.
5. **User Authentication**: Integrated with **Internet Identity** for secure login.




## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install **dfx (Dfinity SDK)**
