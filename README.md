# BITPAY - Bitcoin Payment System with Internet Computer

## Overview
This project introduces a revolutionary Bitcoin Payment System leveraging the Internet Computer (ICP) and ckBTC to provide fast, low-cost, and secure cryptocurrency transactions.

## Key Features

### Bitcoin Network Integration
- Direct integration with Bitcoin testnet
- Utilizes Internet Computer's Bitcoin Integration API
- Supports UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) tracking

### ckBTC Transaction Mechanism
- Uses ckBTC for fast, low-cost transactions
- Enables instant settlement (compared to traditional Bitcoin transactions)
- Supports 1:1 backed synthetic Bitcoin token

### Payment Request Management
- Generate unique payment requests
- Track transaction status
- Handle different payment stages (pending, detected, confirmed)

### Advanced Confirmation Handling
- Rapid transaction confirmation strategy
- Minimal confirmation time approach
- Dynamic status tracking for Bitcoin transactions

### Merchant-Friendly Features
- Support for multiple merchants
- Subaccount management
- Automated conversion and transfer mechanisms

### Security Features
- Trustless, non-custodial transaction handling
- Utilizes Internet Computer's secure canister architecture
- Implements transaction status verification

### Network Flexibility
- Supports both testnet and potential mainnet configurations
- Adaptable to different Bitcoin network environments

### Technical Innovations
- Leverages Threshold ECDSA signatures
- Uses Internet Computer's native blockchain capabilities
- Implements advanced transaction monitoring

### Unique Technical Capabilities
- Fast finality (approximately 1 second)
- Low transaction cost (approximately $0.01)
- Direct Bitcoin network access
- Ability to retrieve UTXOs
- Check balances in real-time

## Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- Internet Computer SDK (dfx)
- Bitcoin Testnet Wallet
- Stable internet connection

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bitcoin-payment-system.git
cd bitcoin-payment-system
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
dfx install
```

### 3. Configure Internet Computer
```bash
dfx identity new btc_payment_admin
dfx identity use btc_payment_admin
```

### 4. Deploy on Testnet
```bash
dfx deploy --network ic
```

## Smart Contract Interactions

### Merchant Registration
Register a new merchant with a unique name and Bitcoin address:
```bash
dfx canister --network ic call BTC_PAYMENT_SYSTEM_backend registerMerchant '("Merchant Name", "tb1q_bitcoin_address")'
```

### Get All Merchants
Retrieve list of registered merchants:
```bash
dfx canister --network ic call BTC_PAYMENT_SYSTEM_backend getAllMerchants
```

### Create Payment Request
Generate a payment request for a specific merchant:
```bash
dfx canister --network ic call BTC_PAYMENT_SYSTEM_backend createPaymentRequest '(merchantId, amount, description)'
```

### Check Payment Status
Monitor the status of a specific payment:
```bash
dfx canister --network ic call BTC_PAYMENT_SYSTEM_backend getPaymentStatus '(paymentId)'
```

## Integration Guide for Merchants

### 1. Register Your Merchant Account
- Obtain a Bitcoin testnet address
- Call `registerMerchant` with your details

### 2. Generate Payment Requests
- Use `createPaymentRequest` to generate unique payment links
- Each request gets a unique `paymentId`

### 3. Track Transactions
- Use `getPaymentStatus` to monitor transaction progress
- Receive real-time updates on payment confirmations

## Security Considerations
- Always use testnet for initial testing
- Implement additional verification layers
- Monitor transaction statuses carefully

## Troubleshooting
- Ensure correct Bitcoin testnet address format
- Verify network connectivity
- Check canister deployment status

## Performance Metrics
- Average Transaction Time: < 3 minutes
- Transaction Cost: < $0.01
- Supported Network: Bitcoin Testnet4

## Future Roadmap
- Mainnet support
- Multi-cryptocurrency integration
- Enhanced merchant dashboard
